# HR Attrition Dashboard [Excel]
## Problem Statement

High employee attrition can significantly impact an organization’s stability, performance, and cost structure. However, many HR teams struggle to quickly identify the underlying causes due to scattered data and lack of clear insights. To address this challenge, I developed an interactive HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard in Excel using Pivot Tables, dynamic charts, and slicers.

### This dashboard enables HR professionals and decision-makers to:

- Visualize key attrition metrics (e.g., attrition rate, age, education level, and job roles) in real-time.

- Identify high-risk segments such as age groups or departments with elevated attrition.

- Slice and filter data dynamically by education and department to support targeted retention strategies.

By consolidating and analyzing data for 1,470 employees, this tool provides actionable insights to proactively manage employee turnover and improve workforce planning.

## Project Goals:

- Monitor key attrition metrics such as total employees, attrition count, active employees, attrition rate, and average age.

- Identify patterns and trends in employee attrition across dimensions like age, gender, department, job role, education level, and marital status.

- Enable data-driven decisions by visualizing high-risk areas (e.g., departments or age groups with high attrition) and supporting root cause analysis through dynamic slicers and visual storytelling.

## How I Built It (Quick Summary)

- Cleaned and structured raw HR data using Excel functions.

- Created dynamic Pivot Tables to calculate KPIs like attrition rate, active employees, and average age.

- Designed interactive visuals using charts (bar, pie, donut, treemap, column) linked to Pivot Tables.

- Added Slicers for Education and Department to enable easy filtering.

- Applied professional layout, colors (ColorHunt), and icons (Flaticon) for a polished dashboard.

## Key Insights 

### Overall Attrition Trends

- Out of 1,470 total employees, 237 have left the organization, leading to an attrition rate of 16.12%.

- The average age of employees is 37, indicating a mid-career workforce.

### Attrition by Age Group

- The highest attrition is seen in the 25–34 age group (112 employees), nearly 47% of total attritions.

- The age group under 25 also shows notable attrition (25 employees), suggesting early-career dissatisfaction or mobility.

### Attrition by Department

- R&D department has the highest attrition at 56%, followed by Sales at 39%.

- HR shows significantly lower attrition, possibly indicating better engagement or job stability.

### Attrition by Job Role

Top roles affected by attrition:

- Laboratory Technician: 62

- Sales Executive: 57

- Research Scientist: 47

These three roles alone account for over 70% of attrition, indicating possible stress, burnout, or dissatisfaction in technical/sales positions.

### Education-Wise Attrition

- Employees with Bachelor’s Degrees have the highest attrition (99), followed by Master’s Degree holders (58).

- Surprisingly, even Doctorate holders (5) show some attrition, pointing toward potential misalignment in advanced roles.

### Marital Status Impact

- Single employees make up the largest group of attrition cases (120, over 50%).

- Married employees: 84

- Divorced: 33

This might indicate that single employees are more mobile or seeking better opportunities.

### Gender Distribution

- The workforce is 60% male and 40% female, as visualized in the donut chart.

- You could investigate whether gender correlates with attrition in a future analysis.

Interactive Filtering

### The dashboard includes slicers to filter by:

- Education level

- Department

This empowers HR users to drill down into specific segments for more granular insights.

##  Final Insight: What Can Be Done?

- Focus retention strategies on younger employees, especially aged 25–34.

- Provide support systems and engagement programs in high-stress departments like Sales and R&D.

- Improve career path clarity and advancement opportunities for employees with graduate-level education.

- Explore gender-specific trends to make the workforce more inclusive and balanced.
